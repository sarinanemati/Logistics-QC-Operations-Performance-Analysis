# Logistics-QC-Operations-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview

Modern logistics companies rely heavily on data to monitor delivery efficiency, reduce delays, and detect patterns in QC issues. This project includes:

- Synthetic logistics dataset generation (deliveries, zones, couriers, QC flags, etc.)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**
- Feature engineering for operational performance analytics
- Machine learning model to predict delivery delays (Late/On-Time classification)
- Operational KPIs & visualizations ready for Power BI dashboards
